I am Noor Hakeem. I love technology. It doesn't matter to me what that Tech Piece is doing. If there are some kind of machine, code & electronics, I am hooked. 

I love traveling, who doesn't. I am a weekend chef, i cook meal for my familiy in the weekend. Rest of the week my wife does that. 

I was a Sushi chef before 2015. I found myself in 2016 in a bit of situation where I had to start from bottom. So I decided why not something I love. That's how I started my Journey as IT Support in a small NGO called Asylplus in a small Town in South Bavaria Germany. By the way I am from Bangladesh.

I want be an MLOps. It's going to tough if not Brutal. As I don't hold any Academic Background. But I want to try. I started since early 2024 practicing variuos topic in ML / AI: 
 
### The ML OPs Journey

To force myself to Write and explain what I just learn. 

And offcourse to share with the Community who are finding themselves is the same Situation.
