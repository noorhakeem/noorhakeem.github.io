## No idea what to write yet

Okay, Finally I have my own site. I can share everything here. 

This is going to be more like a Educational journal. I will share everything small or big here what I am 
Learning. I will try to update everyweek if not every other week. 

Right now I am Reading the book Python Crash Course from no Starch Press. 

May be after I finish the book I will do a Summary here. 

At of this point I Am reading the Funchtion and Class in Python. It has some Project also. I will publish those project also. They are goping to be in my GitHub page as well. 

That's It  for today. See you next Time.
